# SpeakCode | nwHacks 2026

> **"Coding is only half the battle."**

Applicants are expected to solve complex problems and explain their solutions—all while coding under a low-time, high-pressure environment. **SpeakCode** helps developers practice technical interviews by evaluating both how they code and how they communicate.

---

## The Problem

Technical interviews are no longer just about getting the green checkmark on LeetCode. Top-tier companies look for:

- **Verbal Reasoning:** Can you explain _why_ you chose a Hashmap over an Array?
- **Communication Clarity:** Can you articulate complex logic while typing?
- **Confidence under Pressure:** How do you handle the ticking clock?

Most platforms only check your syntax. **SpeakCode checks your voice.**

## Features

- **Voice-First Evaluation:** Uses AI to listen to your verbal reasoning in real-time.
- **Clarity & Confidence Scoring:** Get deep feedback on your pacing, tone, and technical correctness.
- **High-Pressure Simulation:** A sleek, minimal IDE designed to mimic the stress of a real-world technical screening.
- **Integrated IDE:** Solve data structures and algorithm problems with a built-in code editor.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS
